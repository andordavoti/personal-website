I watched some YouTube videos from some experienced builders and read some posts on the esk8 builders forums. Then I ordered the parts, which were the longboard deck, trucks, and wheels. For electrifying it, I ordered a motor mount, high power BLDC motor, powerful BLDC VESC (an open-source motor controller which allows more customizability than a standard BLDC ESC), belt drive kit with suitable gears, wireless remote, BMS, and high power Samsung 18650 lithium battery cells. I spot welded the battery cells with a 6S4P configuration (6 cells in series, 4 cells in parallel). The enclosure underneath the board was custom built to fit, and I also designed, and 3D printed some custom covers for the drive train. I ended up with a really powerful board with over three horsepower (2500W), a range of over 30km, and a top speed between 25-35km/h.",

This made full movement and turning possible for the robot.',
            'The brains of the robot was an Arduino Uno with a motor controller shield connected to the two motors. I added a servo motor with a sonar sensor on the top of the robot to give it spacial awareness. It wasn\'t a practical robot, more of a learning and "show off" project. So the primary function it was programmed to do is to roll around the room autonomously with somewhat smart decisions. It "looked" left and right with its sonar sensor, then measured the distances and continued to the path with most space, over and over again, indefinitely.',
            'Later I also added a BlueTooth module to the robot. I wrote an Android app for my phone, which allowed me to control it like an RC car and also activate an autonomous mode.',

After watching some build guides on YouTube, I decided to go for it. So I saved up and ordered the parts from China.',

I was lucky enough to have the internet as a resource and just watched countless videos on the topic.",

I configured the flight controller with the right firmware and settings, calibrated the ESCs, and was ready to fly. I ran it on a three-cell battery pack, which gave it approximately 10 minutes of flight time and fantastic performance.',
